    <i>Recommendation: This visualization run best on Google Chrome and Safari.</i>
    <h3>1. Visual components</h3>

    We have shown the main components of <b>IoTNegViz</b> in our submitted manuscripts. Due to the limit of space for
    presentation, the details can be found here. The following figures shows main components of <b>IoTNegViz</b>: A)
    The Utility component, B) The Topics stream, and C) The Dynamic network. Each negative aspect is represented by a
    term in these visualization.<br><br>


    <li><b> Box A - Utility component:</b>

        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ◦ Search toolbox offers autocomplete search suggestions listed below<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ◦ <b>Use cases</b> page shows the findings of the visualization and details
        for visual components.
        <b>Demo</b> page illustrates a demonstration with interactive tool of <b>IoTNegViz</b>.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ◦ Display mode is default to present data by day. The <b>Weekly</b>
        and <b>Stack</b> options can be both choosen at the same time. The <b>Weekly</b> option is for
        displaying by week instead of day as default, and the <b>Stack</b> option is for stacking layers on top of each
        other.
        <br><br>
    </li>

    </li>
    <li><b> Box B - An area among the topic stream:</b> Along with the timeline in the upper part of the
        screen, there are two streams in this visualization: The
        orange layer is for accidents that refer to the negative aspects, and the blue one is for the potential
        risks may occur. The shape of the stream directly associates with the stream’s thickness, which indicates the
        total frequency of the inside terms.
        The significance of each word is constructed based on its frequency, then emphasized in the visualization by its
        size and color opacity.<br><br>

    <li><b>Button C and Box C - The Dynamic Network:</b> When users click on the button, a dynamic graph
        slides out. This is a force directed graph showing the connection and relationship between the negative
        aspects. A term is considered significant if it has multiple connections with other items. <br><br>


        <div style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5em;margin-right: 5em"><img src="src/img/compo.png"
                                                                                width="80%"/><img
                src="src/img/boxc.png" width="80%"/></div>

        <!--===================================================-->
        <h3>2. Terms in trending</h3>
        When a term is moused over, the term is highlighted along with its corresponding terms in the same stream. A
        detail box for tooltip pops up with the information: Term, date and frequency at that date. In the figure below,
        <span style="color:#2077b5">cybersecurity</span> is highlighted:<br><br>
    <li><b>Vertically:</b> The related terms with <span style="color:#2077b5">cybersecurity</span> in the same
        day (Feb 28, 2018) are also emphasized, such as <span style="color:#2077b5">analytics</span>, <span
                style="color:#2077b5">ai</span> (Artificial Intelligence), <span style="color:#2077b5">bigdata
    </span>, and <span
                style="color:#2077b5">sensors</span>. Based on this presentation, users can capture the topic derived
        from these relevant terms.
    </li>

    <li><b>Horizontally:</b> All the other <span style="color:#2077b5">cybersecurity</span> terms in the same
        stream are featured. From this illustration, users can see how often a term is mentioned throughout the
        timeline, and its significance in each time step.
    </li>
    <br><br>

    <div style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5em;margin-right: 5em"><img src="src/img/cyber.png" width="80%"/></div>

    <br><br>In the dynamic graph below, the more connection a node has, the more significant that term is. The terms
    in red boxes are some of the most important ones due to their big amount of connections, depicting the various
    relationships they have with other nodes in the same domain. They are <span
        style="color:#d13a20">cybersecurity</span>, <span
        style="color:#d13a20">ai</span>, <span style="color:#d13a20">iiot</span>
    (Industrial Internet of Things), <span style="color:#d13a20">gdpr</span> (General Data Protection Regulation), and
    <span style="color:#d13a20">ddos</span> (Distributed Denial of Service).<br><br>
    The orange box shows the concerns related to the accidents that happened regrading to IoT: <span
        style="color:#f08c55">autonomousvehicles</span>, <span style="color:#f08c55">
    crash</span>, <span style="color:#f08c55">accident</span> and <span style="color:#f08c55">
    safety</span>. This also present the importance of raising awareness about the downsides of a cyber physical
    system.<br><br>

    <h3>3. Groups of co-occurrence terms</h3>
    The figure below shows two groups of co-occurrence terms, indicated by two group colors: green and red. The
    co-occurrence depicts that these terms are relevant to each others, and there is an above-chance frequency based
    on the relationships among them.
    <br><br>
    The group denoted by green boxes presents the co-occurrences of <span style="color:#f08c55">accident</span>,
    <span style="color:#f08c55">travelalert</span> and <span style="color:#f08c55">crash</span>.
    <br><br>
    The group denoted by red boxes presents the co-occurrences of <span style="color:#2077b5">cybersecurity</span>,
    <span style="color:#2077b5">vulnerability</span>, and <span style="color:#2077b5">privacy</span> <br><br><br>
